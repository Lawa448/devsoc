                <br>
                <br>
                    <li>My main and most expensive hobby is rhythm games particularly maimai which is real financial commitment but I also play some project sekai and osu mania!</li>
                    <li>This year i'm trying to read more and recently I've been really interested in non-ficiton books about gut health (haha) and I also read alot of horror and psychological manga.</li>
                    <li>Another new interest is drawing, I really enjoy drawing on pencil and paper but I've wanted to learn digital art for a long while...</li>
